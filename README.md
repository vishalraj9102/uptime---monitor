- **Website Monitoring**: Monitor websites for uptime and downtime.
- **Discord Notifications**: Receive alerts when a website goes down or recovers.
- **Background Task**: Continuously monitor websites in the background using Celery or asyncio.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Add/remove websites to monitor
  - Get monitoring status for websites
  - Configure Discord webhook for notifications
- **Data Persistence**: Store site status history in **PostgreSQL**.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid URLs, network timeouts, and Discord webhook failures.

## Installation üõ†

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11+**: Install the latest version of Python.
2. **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerization (optional but recommended).
3. **PostgreSQL**: For data storage.

### Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/uptime-monitor.git
    cd uptime-monitor
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**:

   You can use a PostgreSQL service via Docker or install it locally.

   - Docker setup:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'

     services:
       postgres:
         image: postgres:latest
         container_name: postgres
         environment:
           POSTGRES_DB: uptime_monitor
           POSTGRES_USER: user
           POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
         ports:
           - "5432:5432"
     ```

4. **Start the application**:

    Run the app with Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Background Task üïê

### Celery for Background Monitoring

Use **Celery** to perform the monitoring task in the background. The worker will check each website at the specified interval.

- **Celery Setup**:

    - **Task**: Check the website's status and send a notification to the configured Discord webhook if the status changes.
    - **Database**: Store status history in PostgreSQL.

---

## Discord Integration üí¨

Set up a **Discord webhook URL** to receive notifications when:

- A site becomes unreachable.
- A site recovers.
- First failed attempt after success.
- First successful attempt after failure.

**Configure Discord Webhook** via the `/webhook` endpoint.

---

## Testing üß™

### Core Monitoring Logic

You can test core monitoring logic using **pytest**.

Example of testing Discord notifications:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from app import notify_discord

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_discord_notification():
    with patch('app.notify_discord.send') as mock_send:
        await notify_discord("Site is down", "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id")
        mock_send.assert_called_once()
```
